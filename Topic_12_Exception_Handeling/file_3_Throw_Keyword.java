    The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.

    ** We can throw only those object of only Throwable class or object of those 
    classes dervied from Throwable **

    we can use throw keyword to rethrow an exception

    {

    }

    public myclass(String mes)
    {
        super(mes);
    }


    // public String toString()
    // {
    //     return "This is custom error message from myclass class";
    // }
 }


public class file_3_Throw_Keyword {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        // we will see about throws in upcoming files 


        // this throw the object of myclass which is an exception class with Throwable as parent 
        // class 

        // the point which is here to note it down is that message which is going to be shown 
        // after throwing the exception 

        // we have multiple ways to do it so 
        
        // one is to override the toString method which is done here with myclass
        // priority is given to this way if both are used 

// ->>>>>>>> //throw new myclass(); 

        // make parameterised constructor to call parent constructor and pass the message from 
        // constructor itself using super keyword 
        // after then dont override the toString method if you are using this way to 
        // pass the message 

        // if we dont pass anything then class name  will be printed insted of 
        // message 



// ->>>>>>>>> //throw new myclass("This is explicit message passed from constructor ");
