    Exception mean      
            :Runtime Errors which can be handled by either by programmer or JVM
            :In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
-
    Error :
            These are the errors which can not be handled at runtime eigher by programmer of JVM
    


    All exceptions belongs to class Exception  it contains 5 types of constructors

All the classes of the RuntimeException are unchecked exceptions 
no need to declare or handle explicitly 

==============================================================
The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except |
RuntimeException and Error  are known as  checked exceptions.| 
For example, IOException,SQLException etc.Checked exceptions |
are checked at compile-time                                  |
==============================================================

        
Checked Exceptions :
------------------
        A checked exception is an exception that is checked (notified) by the compiler
        at compilation-time, these are also called as compile time exceptions.   These
        exceptions cannot  simply  be  ignored,  the  programmer  should  take care of
        (handle) these exceptions.

Unchecked Exceptions :
-------------------
        An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. 
        These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs,
        such  as logic errors or improper use   of an API. Runtime   exceptions are
        ignored at the time of compilation.

Java Errors :
------------
        These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control
        of  the  user or  the programmer. Errors are typically ignored in your code
        because you can rarely do anything about an error. For example, if a  stack
        overflow occurs, an error will arise.  They are also ignored at the time of
        compilation.
