        Thread synchronization in JAVA

        Multiple co-operative threads causes the problems like 

        1 ] Race condition 
        2 ] Critical section problem 
        3 ] Shared memory problem 


        There are multiple solution to achieve synchronization 
        1 ] Semaphores 
        2 ] Mutex (Locks)
        3 ] Monitors 

        In Java it is implemented using Monitors 

        Monitors is the collection of the variables and the functions used to achieve 
        Synchronization problem properly 


        So there is a need to synchronize the action of multiple threads and make sure
        that only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time. This is
        implemented using a concept called monitors
                                        -----------

        Basically Monitor is the collection of required classes and objects to achieve 
        Concept like synchroinzation in java 

        It is the software approach to handle the multiple threads and their execution 

        As Threads in java is the user level threads 
        which are 
            scheduled 
            controlled 
            executed 

        in user level mode and not in kernel leve 
        so this is not actual multi threading where multiple threads running at a time 
        but it used round robbin scheduling algorithm which feels that multiple threads 
        are running  at a time 



        There are two types of thread synchronization mutual exclusive and inter-thread communication.

        Mutual Exclusive :
                Synchronized method.
                Synchronized block.
                Static synchronization.
        Cooperation :(Inter-thread communication in java)
                Threads which are dependent on each other (ex : producer consumer threads )

        
                
        Mutual Exclusive:
        ==================
        1 ] Synchronized block  (Java synchronized block is more efficient than Java synchronized method.)
        2 ] Synchronized Method 
        3 ] Static Synchronization (If you make any static method as synchronized, the lock will be on the class not on object.)
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        concept of lock 
        ===============
            From Java 5 the package java.util.concurrent.locks contains several 
            lock implementations.
        
        


    When one method is working for same object but executed by different threads 
    then only synchronization is applied and only one thread is able to  execute
    the method due to synchronization 




    Problem with static synchronization 

    if two threads running for same object of same class 
    then there is no any locking for that object threads despite of synchronization of 
    static method both threads will execute the method 

    but if two threads are working for different objects then synchronization
    is applied there as they belongs to same class and different objects 

    refer for more info : https://www.javatpoint.com/static-synchronization-example




    Java Reentrant class 
      refere https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_reentrant_monitor.htm

      This is fameous lock based synchroniazation class present in java.util.concurrent.locks
    




      // the lock concept is based on object and not on method 

      // blocked state (synchronized) <=====> 




      synchronized block 

      there are three ways to lock the block 

      1 ] this object 

      synchronized(this)
      {

      }


      2 ] particular object o

      synchronized(o)
      {

      }

      3 ] class level synchroniazed block 

      synchronized(CLASSNAME.class)
      {

      }






     *************** Deadlock ***************


     There are no resolution techniques for deadlock 
     but we can avoid the deadlock
