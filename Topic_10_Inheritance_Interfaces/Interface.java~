			Interface 
			
		
		1 ] we use interface keyWord
		
		
		All the methods inside interface are public and abstract by default 
		
		ex 
		
		interface MyInterface
		{
			void show();
			public void show();
			abstract void show();
			abstract public void show();
		}
		
		all the above four decearation has same meaning
		== abstract public void show()
		
		
		
		
		2 ] Interface can contain data memebers also 
		
			those data members are static and final 
			
			but as they are final one rule is different that is 
			they must be initialized at the time of declaration only 
			
			
		to inherite interface we use 
			implements  keyWord
