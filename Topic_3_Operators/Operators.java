		Operators in Java 
		
		1] Unary Operator ++ , -- 

		2] Arithmetic Operator + -  * /  

		3] Shift Operator >> << >>> 

		4] Relational Operator  ==  <= >=  < > !=  return boolean 

		5] Bitwise Operator & | ! ^ ~  << >> >>>  always returns int 

		6] Logical Operator || && !  return boolean values  Shot-circuit 
		
		7] Ternary Operator (Conditional operator ? :)
		
		8] Assignment Operator. = += -= *= /=
